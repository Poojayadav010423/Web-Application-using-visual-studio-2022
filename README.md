Web applications were developed utilising ASP.NET, ADO.NET, and C#.
These web applications contain several pages, including landing, registration, login, admin, home, about, and contact us pages.
Users can register with their name, username, and password, but they must also use their username and password to log in.
The admin page allows the administrator to effectively insert, amend, and delete any user account.
